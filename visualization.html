    <h2>FAFSA Application Trends and Institutional Factors</h2>

    <p>
      This project explores our dataset (<em>cleaned.csv</em>) with multiple
      charts. We can switch among quarters (Q1..Q5) for selected charts, and we
      have an aggregated line chart and stacked bar chart for Q1..Q5.
    </p>

    <p>
      This analysis examines quarterly enrollment trends (Q1–Q5) across 1,271 U.S. educational institutions in different states. The dataset compares dependent and independent student enrollment patterns at public, private, and proprietary schools, identified by OPE ID, name, location, and type. The cleaned and standardized data enables deeper investigation of seasonal enrollment impacts, financial aid policy effects on student dependency ratios, and regional education disparities. These insights support policymaking, academic research, and institutional planning by revealing comparative enrollment trends and enabling predictive modeling. The preprocessing work established a strong foundation for robust statistical analysis of these educational patterns.

    <h2>Distribution of FAFSA Applications (Histogram)</h2>
    <div id="altair-histogram" class="chart-svg"></div>
    <p class="takeaway">
      <strong>Takeaway:</strong> The histogram shows how FAFSA applications are distributed across schools. Most institutions receive fewer applications, while a small group has significantly higher totals, indicating a skewed distribution.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Top 10 Institutions by FAFSA Applications</h2>
    <div id="bar-chart"></div>
    <p class="takeaway">
      <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This bar chart highlights the top 10 institutions with the highest FAFSA applications. Most are large public universities, suggesting their scale and accessibility play a major role in financial aid demand.
    </p >

    <h2>FAFSA Applications by State (Map)</h2>
    <div id="map"></div>
    <p class="takeaway">
      <strong>Takeaway:</strong> The map visualizes FAFSA totals by state. States with larger populations—such as California, Texas, and New York—stand out, reflecting both demographic size and institutional reach.
    </p >

    <h2>Dependent vs. Independent Applicants</h2>
    <div class="controls">
      <label for="stateDropdown">Filter by State:</label>
      <select id="stateDropdown"></select>
    </div>
    <div id="scatter-plot"></div>
    <p class="takeaway">
      <strong>Takeaway:</strong> X-axis: Dependent students. Y-axis: Independent students. This scatter plot compares dependent and independent student applicants. It reveals differences in student populations served by each institution.
    </p >

    <h2>Top 10 States by FAFSA Applications: Dependent vs. Independent</h2>
    <div id="state-bar-chart"></div>
    <p class="takeaway">
      <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This grouped bar chart compares the number of dependent and independent applicants across the top 10 states. It highlights differences in student demographics by region and provides insight into where financial aid demand is highest among different student types.
    </p >
    
    <h2>FAFSA Applications by Institution Type</h2>
    <div id="altair-boxplot" class="chart-svg"></div>
    <p class="takeaway">
       <strong>Takeaway:</strong> This interactive boxplot displays FAFSA application distributions by institution type across five quarters. Public institutions consistently show the highest median application totals, indicating they serve a larger student population seeking aid. Private institutions exhibit greater variability, while proprietary and unknown institutions tend to have lower application volumes.
